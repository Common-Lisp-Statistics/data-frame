#+TITLE: Data Frame

  This library implements a data structure conceptually similar to a [[https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/data.frame][R
  data frame]].  The library is experimental; comments and feedback are
  welcome whilst we sort out the best usage patterns.

* User Manual

  The user manual needs writing. If you are a newcomer to
  data-frames, this project is not quite ready yet. For now, look at
  the unit tests, where there are plenty of examples of how to use a
  data frame.

* Reference manual

  The [[https://Lisp-Stat.github.io/data-frame/][reference manual]] documents the API.

* Reporting bugs

  Please report bugs using the [[https://github.com/Lisp-Stat/data-frame/issues][issue tracker]].
